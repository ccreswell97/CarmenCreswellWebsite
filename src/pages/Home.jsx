                            I'm an experienced software engineer with degrees in Computer Science, Cybersecurity, and Web Design. I have experience working with both front and backend systems, architeching apps from the ground up, and working on a distributed team with members in many different times zones. I made this website from scratch so I can have examples of my work and have an easy place to link my projects. It also serves as an easy-to-read resume.
